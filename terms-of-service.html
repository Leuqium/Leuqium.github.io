        <br><br>

        These Terms of Service (Referred as “Terms” or “ToS”) set out the terms and condition by which the artist offers you this service, and these Terms are an agreement between you and me.
        The commissioner will be asked to fill a form accepting these Terms, and will collect their e-mail as a proof of signature. The e-mail will be kept private.
        
        <br><br>

        <h3>GENERAL</h3>
        I have the right to decline any request and/or cancel a current commission. Any requests involving subjects of political nature, extremely explicit NSFW, or illegal depiction of underaged minors, will automatically be declined. 
        To avoid further issues, commissioners are invited to hold any form of communication in a civilized manner and to be as clear as possible.
        
        Please be sure that your e-mail address is the same as the e-mail linked with your PayPal account.
        
        <br><br>

        <h3> 1. ELIGIBILITY & AGREEMENT </h3>
        To request a commission, you as the commissioner, or client, must either: 
        I. be an adult; 
        II. be an emancipated minor; 
        III. have valid parent or legal guardian consent to be bound by these Terms. 
        If you’re not an adult or emancipated minor, or don’t understand this section, please talk to your parents or legal guardian and ask for help. If you are the parent or legal guardian of the minor requesting a commission, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound by these Terms. You are also responsible for the compliance with these Terms by the minor, and any payment made after.
        
        <br><br>

        <h3>2. PRODUCT & ETC</h3>
        The product will be digital, and will be a .png file (+ additional files if needed) with an image size based on the client personal preference (If not specified it is not less than 4000x4000 pixel), compressed to a .rar file scanned on VirusTotal. A .psd file will be included for an additional fee (See Section 3 about Pricing).
        The estimated time of completion (ETC) for your commission can be up to 3 months depending on many factor such as: 
        I.Personal circumstances (Health, university, family issues);
        II.Work (Commission order and priority, personal works);
        I will be notifying the client about the progress of the drawing and asking for opinions, and it is in the other party’s best interest to be communicative as much as possible.
        
        <br><br>

        <h3>3. PRICING</h3>
        The prices of digital products are as quoted in my social from time to time, and discussed with the client.
        Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect commissions in respect of which I’m already working on. Be aware that I have the right to modify them at any time.
        Additional fees may be applied on commission complexity and difficulty, and are different based on illustration subject (i.e.; Anthropomorphic, Mechanical, Non-humanoid etc.).
        If you request your finished final commission to not be posted and be kept private there may be a privacy fee.
        The client is allowed to any changes before the artwork's rendering (i.e. coloring and painting) and completion. Keep in mind that additional small changes could result in a fee of 2%. 
        PSD file is available for 5% of total price.
        You can buy commercial use for you commission for the 250% of total price.

        I. Cancellation made by me, the artist. In this case a full refund will be given, regardless of the product’s progress; 
        II. Cancellation asked by the commissioner, in which a partial refund will be given based on the progress of the drawing, plus an additional fee of 10% of total price for the request to cancel. Partial refund shall not exceed 90% of the total price.
